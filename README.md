Learning Audit and Action üèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèΩ

Pause, Reflect, Plan then Take Action 
When you're learning at such a fast pace it's really important to not lose yourself in the day-to-day struggle. You have to build the ability to stop yourself and find a moment of clarity. You can use that moment to reflect, plan and take action.

We want you to do that now. We would recommend going for a walk or doing the NSDR mediation.

Now you've stopped and paused we want you to do a mini "learning audit". What does a learning audit look like?

Make a list containing a list item for each Course Module you've done so far (On-boarding, Software, Frontend, Backend, Database).
For each item (Course Module) make a sub list containing the things we asked you to learn that week.
Next to each sub list item give yourself a confidence rating of (Green, Orange or Red). 
Now prioritise and pick 3 items to take action on (self-study / practice).
Now learn and practice.
Example (showing reflection of one module):
Learning Audit for Front End only.

- Semantic HTML and Basic of CSS Layouts (RED)
- DOM selectors (RED)
- Button click and Form Submit (GREEN)
- Fetch (ORANGE)
- Async JavaScript (GREEN)
- Async/Await (ORANGE)

Learning Plan and Priorities

Semantic HTML / CSS Layouts:
Found it hard to put into practice. I wasn‚Äôt sure when to use certain tags. I need to build a few more websites with HTML to get used too quickly and correctly structuring a page.
CSS Grid was ok, I could build basic stuff. But I found Flexbox quite difficult and all I wanted to do was align some items. I want to practice making a website header with a logo, navigation list and button.
DOM
I was able to get DOM nodes but found it hard to change text values in nodes. I need write some simple JS that selects DOM nodes and reads text or html attributes.
Fetch
I could write a simple fetch request but I found error handling hard. I still don‚Äôt get how it works. I want to write a small script to get data from an API but I‚Äôll turn off my internet to see how to handle errors (like no internet)

How to work:
Accept the Github Assignment.
Make a markdown file called learning-audit.md in the empty repo.
Write your learning audit in there including the prioritised plan of action.
The plan should prioritise 3 things you want to become more confident on over the weekend.
The plan could also include the "how" you plan to become more confident (articles, videos, courses, code katas - and links to them)
Take action on the prioritised plan and do that learning.
We want to see you make commits to the repo over the weekend showing either learning notes or code (practicing things)
