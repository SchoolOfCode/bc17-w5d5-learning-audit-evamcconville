Onboarding 
G - Computational Thinking
G - Problem solving
O - AI 
O - GitHub
G - Mindset 
G - Learning how to learn 

AI: Can’t recall the details and nuances of different types of ai - go over notes
Github: can’t recall how to use rebase and change head - revisit the git game

Software
O - Loops
G - Functions
G - Scope
G - Arrays
G - Objects
R - Array Methods
G - Callbacks
O - Debugging

Loops: can’t remember different situations that different types are used- quick research 
Debugging: never practiced using debugging tools - quick research 
Array methods: can’t remember map, splice, find and not acquainted with loads of useful common methods- long arduous research 

Front-end
R - CSS layout
G - Semantic HTML
G - DOM selectors
O - Event listeners
G - JSON
G - Promises
G - Async/Await
O - Fetch data
G - Error Handling

CSS layout: flexbox flexbox die flexbox - cry && avoid
Event listeners: can’t remember many types- quick research 
Fetch data: can’t remember detail of getting the data needed from the response - redo the hackathon myself

Back-end
G - Node.js
O - CRUD 
G - RESTful API
G - Request handling
G - Helper functions
O - Importing/exporting
R - Reading/writing files

CRUD: vague on update, patch - finish the hackathon myself
Importing/exporting: can't remember the differences and syntax for default and other type - go over notes
Reading/writing files: haven't written to a file - practice in the hackathon

Databases
G - SQL
G - Queries SIUD
O - Joins
O - Subqueries
G - API to database
O - ERDs

Joins: always get left and right mixed up - go over notes
Subqueries: can’t even remember the syntax - research and try some of the sql games
ERDs: only have basic overview  - quick research 

Plan
Reading/writing files: haven't written to a file - practice in the hackathon
Array methods: can’t remember map, splice, find and not acquainted with loads of useful common methods - long arduous research and practice
CRUD: finish this weeks hackathon myself
